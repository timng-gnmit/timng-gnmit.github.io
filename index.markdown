# Hello there!
I'm Timothy Ng, but most people just call me Tim. I'm currently pursuing my Master of Data Science at the University of California, Irvine, and I expect to graduate in December 2025. I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of California, Davis in June 2023.

I'm still working on this website, so please come back for updates! In the meantime, feel free to check out what I'm up to on [GitHub/timng-gnmit](https://github.com/timng-gnmit). Thanks for coming by!
