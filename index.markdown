Hello there! I'm Tim, a current graduate student at the University of California, Irvine pursuing my Master's in Data Science; I expect to graduate in December 2025. Before that, I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in June 2023.

If you wish to contact me, please visit my [About page](https://timng-gnmit.github.io/about). I'm still working on this website, so keep checking the website for updates. Thanks for coming by!
